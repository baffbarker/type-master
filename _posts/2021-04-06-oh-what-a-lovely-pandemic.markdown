Right then,

It ought to be quite clear right now that what we have experienced the last year was only meant to last 3 weeks to "flatten the curve". Lest anyone thinks I was making light of the last year, the title was being facetious about the nightmare we have collectively been through. There is a 1960s parody movie about the horrors of WW2 called "Oh What a Lovely War!" which sends up nostalgia for that era well. 

Once I stopped panicking in the first few weeks and months, I began to research "under the radar" on forums and resolved to undertake several long terms tasks:

  * Get as fit as possible in the Great Outdoors, winter Nordic skiing and summer mountain biking in the Alps
  * Attempt to secure a year round food supply. You see, the main season runs from last Frost to late autumn. What happens during the winter? Well one solution is what's known as a Hot Bed using heat from horse manure, allowing cultivation of very pre-frost crops. I ate radishes in early April! Additionally, I wish to try growing salad trays indoors in December.  
  * Learning to code in Java. A nice British man gave me access to his website packed with tutorials on the Java language. When I'm done, I should be able to code up web shops, database based apps such as library systems and the like.

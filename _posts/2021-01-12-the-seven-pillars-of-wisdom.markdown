Right then,

So over the next seven posts I am going to take you through the tools this group use to retain their powerful position. By the time we are done, you should be able to join the Brotherhopod itself Just when you get to the door, don't say I sent you!

Thank you for your attention to my jottings. I have other posts coming, such as how I use waste food, my activities in coding in Java, and others of a more "conspiratorial" nature such as Gnosticism, Christianity, Freemasonry and the crazy stuff going on now.

So, if you have any input, drop a comment below this post using the "Disqus" system. I look forward to hearing from all of you!

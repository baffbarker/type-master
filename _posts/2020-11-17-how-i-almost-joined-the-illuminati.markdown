Right then,

I want you to take a look at the image from Google Earth of what may be one the most valuable piece of land on earth. Why? This is Ras Tanura oil terminal, the spigot of oil from which flows much of the petrol you put in your tank. The tap was turned on in the 1930s by Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud and transformed this desert into one of the most important places on earth. To the right of the headland lies the Arabian Gulf, to the left Tarut Bay which I spent quite a few days on King Fahd University research boats monitoring coral reefs, mangroves and mapping biotopes. I had the fortune to spend five years snorkelling/diving Saudi's reefs on the east and west coast, and camping in its awesome deserts. Most of my adventure travel was in a small Lada Niva which, when I left in 1999 I had to sell. One of the chaps who came to look at it told me he needed it for meetings in Ras Tanura of his lodge. When I asked him what this was about he told me the Masonic Lodge. I told him my uncle had been a Mason and I might wish to join. We got chatting. I asked who could join? He told me everyone - Saudis, westerners, everyone. Then he told me to join, they ask you two questions:

1. Do you believe in God?
2. Do you believe in Universal Brotherhood?

Now these questions seem innocent enough, but if you think about it, it means Christians and Muslims come together as one. Now take that further. If you are a "brother" who must help another brother, does that mean there may be an overarching network which regards itself as "enlightened" with you non members as an outsider? Do relationships on the inside trump all borders and ideologies?

This realization led me to explore what this organization is all about, to the Da Vinci code mystery and its origins in the Languedoc in France in Rennes Le Chateau, whgich I visited twice. What I came to realize was that this seemingly harmless organiatsion has caused a lot of our present problems. 

So over the next seven posts I am going to take you through the tools this group use to retain their powerful position. By the time we are done, you should be able to join the Brotherhopod itself Just when you get to the door, don't say I sent you!

Thank you for your attention to my jottings. I have other posts coming, such as how I use waste food, my activities in coding in Java, and others of a more "conspiratorial" nature such as Gnosticism, Christianity, Freemasonry and the crazy stuff going on now.

So, if you have any input, drop a comment below this post using the "Disqus" system. I look forward to hearing from all of you!
